    QUE- A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

        Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

        You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

        You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.



        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
        Output: 2
        Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
